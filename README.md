# Getting And Cleaning Data Project
This project if for wearable device data processing before the data analysis. 
Original data source : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Overview
1. run_analysis.R file is R code for data pre-processing. 
2. HCI HAR Data set folder have original data set. (Wearable device sensor measurments) 
3. tidy_data.txt file is output for running run_analysis.R script
4. Codebook.md file 

## About run_analysis.R script
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## About Codebook.md
1. Detail information about R source code and output features.
